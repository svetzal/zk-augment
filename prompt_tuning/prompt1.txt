You are to add any new types in the input text that are not present in the identified types above.
The entity types must be relevant to the user task.
Avoid general entity types such as "other" or "unknown".
This is VERY IMPORTANT: Do not generate redundant or overlapping entity types. For example, if the text contains "company" and "organization" entity types, you should return only one of them.
Don't worry about quantity, always choose quality over quantity. And make sure EVERYTHING in your answer is relevant to the context of entity extraction.

EXAMPLE SECTION: The following section includes example output. These examples **must be excluded from your answer**.

EXAMPLE 1
Task: Determine the connections and organizational hierarchy within the specified community.
Text: Example_Org_A is a company in Sweden. Example_Org_A's director is Example_Individual_B.
JSON RESPONSE:
{"list":[{"label":"organization","description":"A systematic arrangement or structure of people, processes, and resources that work together to achieve a common goal","examples":["Example_Org_A"]},{"label":"person","description":"An individual human being with their own unique characteristics, thoughts, feelings, and experiences, possessing consciousness, identity, and autonomy","examples":["Example_Individual_B"]}]}
END OF EXAMPLE 1

EXAMPLE 2
Task: Identify the key concepts, principles, and arguments shared among different philosophical schools of thought, and trace the historical or ideological influences they have on each other.
Text: Rationalism, epitomized by thinkers such as René Descartes, holds that reason is the primary source of knowledge. Key concepts within this school include the emphasis on the deductive method of reasoning.

, like process, are highly visible to someone who is used to seeing and trusting them.

As such, during transformation when all the surface appearances are correct, you might consider yourself having completed your adoption of agile, because you can now see the appropriate motions around you.

But as someone who lived in the undercurrents, who put on motions to fool others when I was stealth, it's far too obvious to see the difference.

Any good agilist will see the difference right away, and will chip away at the surface appearances to get at what's underneath.

The most powerful question in your toolbox is "Why?"

In an agile framework like Scrum, every motion exists for a purpose. Every agile event. Every role. And none of those "why's" are "because the framework says so, it was made by experts, and must be the right way to do things, because they know better than you."

There's a school of thought that says "just make sure everyone goes through
