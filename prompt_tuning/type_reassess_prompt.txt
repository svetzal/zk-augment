INPUT TEXT:
We don't really give children much authority, because they have to learn quite a bit about how not to hurt themselves. If they choose to eat all their Halloween candy before they go to bed that night, they sure aren't going to feel very well that night or the morning after. They have a lot to learn, and as parents we make ever widening rules or guardrails to help them learn how to make good decisions, in hopes that by the age we give them authority, when we stop controlling what decisions they can make, they will continue to make good decisions.
