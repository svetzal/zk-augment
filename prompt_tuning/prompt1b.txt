The goal is to study the connections and relations between the entity types and their features in order to understand all available information from the text.
Your job is to extract types for any entities mentioned in the input text.
Avoid general entity types such as "other" or "unknown".
This is VERY IMPORTANT: Do not generate redundant or overlapping entity types. For example, if the text contains "company" and "organization" entity types, you should return only one of them.
Don't worry about quantity, always choose quality over quantity. And make sure EVERYTHING in your answer is relevant to the context of entity extraction.

, like process, are highly visible to someone who is used to seeing and trusting them.

As such, during transformation when all the surface appearances are correct, you might consider yourself having completed your adoption of agile, because you can now see the appropriate motions around you.

But as someone who lived in the undercurrents, who put on motions to fool others when I was stealth, it's far too obvious to see the difference.

Any good agilist will see the difference right away, and will chip away at the surface appearances to get at what's underneath.

The most powerful question in your toolbox is "Why?"

In an agile framework like Scrum, every motion exists for a purpose. Every agile event. Every role. And none of those "why's" are "because the framework says so, it was made by experts, and must be the right way to do things, because they know better than you."

There's a school of thought that says "just make sure everyone goes through
